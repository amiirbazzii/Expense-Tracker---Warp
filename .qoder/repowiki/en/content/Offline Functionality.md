## Introduction
The Offline Functionality in the Expense Tracker application has been completely redesigned with a local-first architecture that prioritizes local data storage and synchronization. This document details the new implementation that enables users to interact seamlessly with the app regardless of internet connectivity. The system uses a sophisticated combination of IndexedDB via localforage for persistent storage, React Context for state management, and a comprehensive sync strategy with conflict detection. Unlike the previous implementation that only queued expenses, the new architecture

### Core Architecture Components
The offline system is built around several key components that work together to provide a seamless user experience:

**OfflineFirstProvider**: The central context provider that manages the state of the offline system, including connectivity status, sync state, and access to core managers.

**LocalStorageManager**: Handles all local data persistence using IndexedDB through the localforage library, providing CRUD operations for expenses, income, categories, and cards.

**CloudSyncManager**: Manages synchronization between local storage and the cloud backend, with robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and operation queuing.

**ConflictDetector**: Provides intelligent conflict detection and resolution capabilities when data divergence occurs between local and cloud storage.

**OfflineFirstProvider** has recently undergone critical fixes to resolve type errors and initialization issues that were affecting conflict detection, sync management, and process queue method signatures. These fixes ensure proper integration between components and reliable offline functionality.
