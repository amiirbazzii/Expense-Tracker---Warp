# Chat API Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

Task 2 from the AI Chat Feature spec has been completed. The following components were created:

### 1. API Route: `/api/chat` (POST)
**File:** `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`

**Features:**
- ✅ Request validation (message length, format, required fields)
- ✅ Authentication middleware (Bearer token verification)
- ✅ Integration with OpenRouter API for AI responses
- ✅ Function calling support for financial data queries
- ✅ Data aggregation using existing Convex backend
- ✅ Natural language date parsing
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with specific error codes
- ✅ Response formatting with timestamps
- ✅ Clarification question detection

**Supported Functions:**
1. `get_category_spending` - Get spending for specific categories
2. `get_total_spending` - Get total spending across all categories
3. `get_top_categories` - Get top N spending categories
4. `compare_categories` - Compare spending between categories

### 2. Documentation
**File:** `src/app/api/chat/README.md`

Complete API documentation including:
- Configuration requirements
- Request/response formats
- Error codes
- Security considerations
- Testing instructions

## Configuration Required

Add these environment variables to `.env.local`:

```bash
# OpenRouter API Key (required)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...

# OpenRouter Model (optional, defaults to free model)
OPENROUTER_MODEL=google/gemini-flash-1.5-8b
```

### Getting an OpenRouter API Key

1. Visit https://openrouter.ai/
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Go to https://openrouter.ai/keys
4. Create a new API key
5. Add it to your `.env.local` file

### Free Models Available

The following models are completely free and support function calling:
- `google/gemini-flash-1.5-8b` (recommended, default)
- `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free`
- `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free`

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Get Your Auth Token

Login to the app and get your auth token from localStorage:
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.getItem('auth-token')
```

### 3. Test with cURL

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "How much did I spend on coffee last month?"
  }'
```

### 4. Expected Response

```json
{
  "message": "You spent $45.50 on Coffee in October 2024.",
  "timestamp": 1698765432000,
  "requiresClarification": false
}
```

## Example Queries

Try these example queries:

1. **Category spending:**
   - "How much did I spend on coffee last month?"
   - "What did I spend on restaurants this year?"

2. **Total spending:**
   - "How much did I spend this month?"
   - "Total spending last quarter?"

3. **Comparisons:**
   - "Did I spend more on coffee or restaurants last month?"
   - "Compare my spending on groceries vs dining out"

4. **Top categories:**
   - "Top 3 categories last month"
   - "What are my biggest expenses this year?"

## Error Handling

The API returns specific error codes for different scenarios:

- `AUTH_ERROR` (401): Invalid or missing authentication token
- `VALIDATION_ERROR` (400): Invalid request format
- `NO_DATA` (200): No transactions found for query
- `API_ERROR` (500/503): Server or OpenRouter API error
- `RATE_LIMIT` (429): Too many requests

## Security Features

✅ User authentication required for all requests
✅ Token validation against Convex backend
✅ User data isolation (only authenticated user's data accessible)
✅ Raw transaction data never sent to OpenRouter
✅ Only aggregated summaries used for AI context
✅ API key stored server-side only

## Integration with Existing Code

The API route integrates seamlessly with:
- ✅ Existing Convex authentication system
- ✅ Existing expense queries and data models
- ✅ Existing date utilities (Jalali/Gregorian support)
- ✅ Existing category and transaction structure

## Next Steps

To complete the chat feature, implement:
- Task 3: Chat message data models and storage
- Task 4: Core chat UI components
- Task 5: Empty state and suggested prompts
- Task 6: Chat navigation and routing
- Task 7: Message submission and response handling

## Verification Checklist

- ✅ API route created at `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`
- ✅ Request validation implemented
- ✅ Authentication middleware added
- ✅ OpenRouter integration complete
- ✅ Function calling implemented
- ✅ Data aggregation connected
- ✅ Error handling comprehensive
- ✅ Response formatting correct
- ✅ Documentation created
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Follows existing code patterns

## Requirements Coverage

- ✅ 6.1: Backend calculator computes numeric results
- ✅ 6.2: AI model cannot generate/estimate values
- ✅ 6.3: Concise answers with specific amounts
- ✅ 6.4: Natural language time phrase resolution
- ✅ 6.5: Raw transaction tables not transmitted
- ✅ 7.1: Helpful error messages
- ✅ 7.2: "No data" message when appropriate
- ✅ 8.1: OPENROUTER_API_KEY from environment
- ✅ 8.2: OPENROUTER_MODEL from environment
- ✅ 8.3: Defaults to free model
- ✅ 8.4: No client-side exposure
