**Changes**:
- Integrated `useOfflineFirstData` hook for cards and categories
- Added offline mode indicator banner

## Requirements

### For Offline Viewing:
1. **Backup exists** - User must have saved backup
2. **Backup is recent** - Shows data from backup date
3. **IndexedDB enabled** - Browser must support it

### For Offline Creation:
- Currently not supported
- Future enhancement: Add offline queue

## Limitations

### Current Limitations:
1. **Read-only viewing** - Can't create/edit/delete offline
2. **Backup age** - Shows old data if backup outdated
3. **No offline queue** - Unlike expenses page
4. **Manual backup** - User must create backup

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Offline queue** - Queue income for sync (like expenses)
2. **Edit offline** - Queue edits for sync
3. **Delete offline** - Queue deletions
4. **Auto-backup** - Automatic periodic backups

## Benefits

✅ **Always Available** - View income anytime
✅ **Fast** - IndexedDB is faster than API
✅ **Reliable** - Works without internet
✅ **User-friendly** - Clear indicators
✅ **Consistent** - Same UX as expenses page

## Technical Details

### Data Sources

**Online**:
- Income: `api.cardsAndIncome.getIncomeByDateRange`
- Categories: `api.cardsAndIncome.getUniqueIncomeCategories`
- Cards: `api.cardsAndIncome.getMyCards`

**Offline**:
- Income: IndexedDB backup (filtered by date)
- Categories: IndexedDB backup (filtered by type='income')
- Cards: IndexedDB backup (mapped to card structure)

### Category Extraction

```typescript
// Extract income category names from offline categories
const offlineIncomeCategoryNames = offlineCategories 
  ? (offlineCategories as any[])
      .filter((cat: any) => cat.type === 'income')
      .map((cat: any) => cat.name)
  : [];
```

### Card Mapping

```typescript
// Map offline cards to expected structure
const cards = offlineCards?.map((card: any) => ({
  _id: card.cardId,
  name: card.cardName,
  userId: '',
  createdAt: 0,
  _creationTime: 0
}));
```

## Comparison with Expenses Page

| Feature | Expenses | Income |
|---------|----------|--------|
| View Offline | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Create Offline | ✅ Queued | ❌ No |
| Edit Offline | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Delete Offline | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Offline Queue | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Auto-sync | ✅ Yes | N/A |
