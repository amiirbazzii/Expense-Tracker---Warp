## Technical Details

### Data Sources

**Online**:
- Income: `api.cardsAndIncome.getIncomeByDateRange`
- Categories: `api.cardsAndIncome.getUniqueIncomeCategories`

**Offline**:

### Category Extraction

```typescript
// Extract income category names from offline categories
const offlineIncomeCategoryNames = offlineCategories 
  ? (offlineCategories as any[])
      .filter((cat: any) => cat.type === 'income')
      .map((cat: any) => cat.name)
  : [];
```

### Card Mapping

```typescript
// Map offline cards to expected structure
const cards = offlineCards?.map((card: any) => ({
  _id: card.cardId,
  name: card.cardName,
  userId: '',
  createdAt: 0,
  _creationTime: 0
}));
```
